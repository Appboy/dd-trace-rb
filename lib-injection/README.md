# Host injection

Our gitlab build pipeline ships a pre-installed tracer deb/rpm package.

Currently, we support

| Environment| version |
|---|---|
| Ruby  | `2.7`, `3.0`, `3.1`, `3.2`|
| OS    | Debian 10+ |
| Arch  | `amd64` |


### Packaging

In order to ship `ddtrace` and its dependencies as a pre-install package, we need a few tweaks in our build pipeline.

* Use multiple custom built Ruby images to build native extensions. Those images are based on Debian `buster` to support older distribution and Ruby is compiled as a static library with `--disbale-shared` option which disables the creation of shared libraries (also known as dynamic libraries or DLLs).
* Install `ffi` gem with its built-in `libffi` instead of system `libffi`.
* After installation, rename directories to remove the `-static` suffix so userâ€™s ruby can detect those  `.so` files and make sure files have read permission.

### Injection

The host inject script would add `ddtrace` to your Ruby on Rails application's `Gemfile` to [instrument your application](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/dd_libraries/ruby/#rails-or-hanami-applications)).

* Bundler version must be >= 2.3
* Does not support vendoring gem (Bundler's deployment mode or `BUNDLE_PATH`)
